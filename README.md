# Malaria-Cell-Image-Classification-System
This report presents the development and evaluation of a malaria cell image classification system. Malaria is a life-threatening disease that affects millions of people worldwide, and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. In this project, we propose a deep learning-based approach for classifying malaria cells as infected or uninfected using microscopic images. The proposed system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is trained on a large dataset of malaria cell images to learn discriminative features.
We evaluate the performance of the proposed system on a separate test dataset, achieving an accuracy of 95.7% in classifying infected and uninfected cells for CNN model and 65.9% for MLP model.
